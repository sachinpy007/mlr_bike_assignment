## General Information
Multiple linear regression has been performed on the dataset.
The project have been done as part of assignment in Linear Regression which comes in Machine Learning module.
Here We have done analysis to find out the factors to increase the number of bike rentals for the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
We have used Boombikes bike rental dataset.

## Conclusions

The R-squared value of the training dataset is 83.5% whereas the test dataset has a value of 79.7% which tella clearly that our model explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.

Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.

The main steps included are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.

Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE are being used and model building is done using statsmodels library.

## Technologies Used

Linear Regression modelling have been performed on the Boombikes bike rental company dataset which is part of an assignment in Executive Post Graduate in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore.
